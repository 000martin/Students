# Student directory [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ScPo-CompEcon/students.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/ScPo-CompEcon/students)

Repository for practicing doing pull requests. 

## How to do this homework

1. Fork this repository (makes a copy on your github account)
1. Clone your forked copy to your computer
1. add a `JSON` file as described below
1. commit to your local repository
1. push to your repo on github
1. submit a pull request to *this* repository (i.e. the original one, owned by the ScPo-CompEcon organisation, at [https://github.com/ScPo-CompEcon/students](https://github.com/ScPo-CompEcon/students)). You do this by clicking on the "New pull request" button on *your* fork of that repo, after you pushed your changes.

## Adding a `JSON` file to introduce yourself

Introduce yourself via a `GITHUB_USERNAME.json` file under the appropriate directory [`_data/spring2016/`](_data/) directory, and submit via pull request. Here's an example:

```json
// this is a comment
// (you should remove this!!!!)
// below is the content of file _data/spring_2016/floswald.json on my computer
{
  "emoji": "radio",
  "introduction": "BBC6music is my favourite radio station",
  "computing": "dynamic models of housing, location and labor"
}
```

Using the format above, replace with your own 

* `emoji` (choose from [this list](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)), 
* `introduction`, which should be something very brief about yourself, and 
* `computing`, where you should state what kinds of computational problems you are (or think you will be) solving.
