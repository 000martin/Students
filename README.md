# Student directory [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/advanced-js/students.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/advanced-js/students)

Repository for practicing doing pull requests. Introduce yourself via a `GITHUB_USERNAME.json` file under the appropriate [`_data/TERM_YEAR/`](_data/) directory, and submit via pull request. Here's an example:

```javascript
// _data/spring_2015/afeld.json
{
  "emoji": "dancer",
  "introduction": "Developer at 18F by day, dancer by night."
}
```

Using the format above, replace with your own `emoji` (choose from [this list](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)) and `introduction`.
