# Student directory [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ScPo-CompEcon/students.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/ScPo-CompEcon/students)

Repository for practicing doing pull requests. Introduce yourself via a `GITHUB_USERNAME.json` file under the appropriate [`_data/TERM_YEAR/`](_data/) directory, and submit via pull request. Here's an example:

```json
// _data/spring_2016/floswald.json
{
  "emoji": "radio",
  "introduction": "BBC6music is my favourite radio station",
  "computing": "dynamic models of housing, location and labor"
}
```

Using the format above, replace with your own 

* `emoji` (choose from [this list](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)), 
* `introduction`, which should be something very brief about yourself, and 
* `computing`, where you should state what kinds of computational problems you are (or think you will be) solving.
